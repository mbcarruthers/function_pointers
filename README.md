Just a small pet project. I was curious if I could create a single variadic template function and create multiple different versions of function pointers to it. It ended up working , thought it was kinda cool.

I compile with : `clang++ -Wall -Werror -std=c++17 main.cpp -o main`

I run with : `./main`
